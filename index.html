                Stephen Hawking was a theoretical physicist and cosmologist best known
                for advancing theoretical models on
                <span class="R"> <a href="#hole" style="color: red;">black holes</a> and <a href="#cosmic"
                        style="color: red;">cosmic inflation</a>
                </span>, which he
                discusses in his popular writing on time and space. Hawking's
                university education began in 1959, when, at age 17, he attended
                University College, Oxford, to study physics. Seeking a PhD at
                University of Cambridge, Hawking was disappointed to learn that the
                esteemed astronomer Fred Hoyle – who is now famous for coining the
                term <span class="R"><a href="https://big-bang.techshock.repl.co/" target="_blank" style="color: red;">'
                        Big Bang' </a></span> theory by mocking it on radio
                – wouldn't be taking any more students. His supervisor was a
                relatively unknown researcher by the name of Dennis Sciama. What
                Sciama lacked in fame he more than made up for in mentorship,
                encouraging a young Hawking to follow his interests. Where Hoyle was
                dismissive of the Big Bang, Hawking became its champion. Between 1979
                and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the
                University of Cambridge. Stephen Hawking, who died Wednesday at the
                age of 76, had lived with the crippling disease ALS for 55 years.

                    Einstein's theory of gravity also tells about singularities i.e. points
                    where space-time appeared to be infinitely curved. But that time it was
                    unclear that whether singularities were real or not. Then, Roger Penrose
                    proved that singularities would indeed form in black holes. Later,
                    Stephen Hawking did path-breaking work on singularities and applied it
                    for whole Universe and told that gravitation produces singularities. He
                    also told that Einstein's theory predicted a singularity which was the
                    big bang theory.<br /><img id="photo-1"

                exponentially soon after the big bang. Further, Hawking was one of the
                first who calculate quantum fluctuations which means the small
                variations in the distribution of matter and shows that during inflation
                it might give rise to the spread of galaxies in the Universe.<br /><img id="photo-2"

                This theory states that time did not exist before the big bang explosion

                    Stephen Hawking discovered the laws of black hole mechanics. - His
                    first law states that the total surface area of the black hole will
                    never get smaller. It is also known as the Hawking area theorem.
                    <br />
                    - Another law states that black holes were hot. But it is a
                    contradiction of classical physics which states that black holes don't
                    radiate heat.
                    <br />
                    - Another law is "no hair" theorem of black holes, which states that
                    black holes can be characterised by three numbers; their mass, angular
                    momentum and charge.
                    <br />
                    - Black holes emit radiation, which may continue till they exhaust
                    their energy and evaporate. This is also known as Hawking radiation.
                    <br />
                    - In January 1971, he won the prestigious Gravity Research foundation
                    Award for his essay titled "Black Holes".

                    but consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions.

                        A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out.
                        The gravity is
                        so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is
                        dying.
                        <br><br>
                        Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes
                        with
                        special
                        tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to
                        black holes act
                        differently than other stars.

                        <br>
                        Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black holes are as small as just
                        one atom.
                        These black holes are very tiny but have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of
                        matter, or
                        "stuff," in an object.
                        <br>
                        Another kind of black hole is called "stellar." Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the
                        mass of the
                        sun.
                        There may be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy is called the
                        Milky Way.
                        <br><br>
                        The largest black holes are called "supermassive." These black holes have masses that are more
                        than 1
                        million
                        suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black
                        hole at its
                        center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius
                        A. It has a
                        mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a very large ball that could hold a few
                        million
                        Earths.

                        Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began.
                        <br><br>
                        Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or
                        collapses. When
                        this
                        happens, it causes a supernova. A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star
                        into space.
                        <br><br>
                        Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in.

                    <br>
                    A black hole can not be seen because strong gravity pulls all of the light into the middle of the
                    black hole.
                    But scientists can see how the strong gravity affects the stars and gas around the black hole.
                    Scientists can
                    study stars to find out if they are flying around, or orbiting, a black hole.
                    <br><br>
                    When a black hole and a star are close together, high-energy light is made. This kind of light can
                    not be seen
                    with human eyes. Scientists use satellites and telescopes in space to see the high-energy light.

                    <br>
                    Black holes do not go around in space eating stars, moons and planets. Earth will not fall into a
                    black hole
                    because no black hole is close enough to the solar system for Earth to do that.
                    <br><br>
                    Even if a black hole the same mass as the sun were to take the place of the sun, Earth still would
                    not fall
                    in. The black hole would have the same gravity as the sun. Earth and the other planets would orbit
                    the black
                    hole as they orbit the sun now.
                    <br><br>
                    The sun will never turn into a black hole. The sun is not a big enough star to make a black hole.
